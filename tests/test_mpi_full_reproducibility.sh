# Diff the HDF5 datasets that exercise coordinated encounters, follows, infections,
# and symptom transitions. The config_2021 fixture does not enable OOE
# relationship generation, so /events/relationships is not a required input
# to this gate.
#
# It also compares seeded counts and the existing daily infection-count logs.
#
# Strategy: run disease_sim at np=1/2/3 into three HDF5 outputs, then use
# a small python+h5py helper to dump each dataset to a sorted canonical
# form (row order varies across runs due to per-rank event buffering;
# determinism is about the *set* of records, not file-offset order).
# A failure prints the first diverging records with full field context.
